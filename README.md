# Tic-Tac-Toe 

This Tic-Tac-Toe game was intended to be viewed in the console of an IDE e.g. IntelliJ.

The game plays itself and the history of movements for each player is printed in the console along with the board.

The size of the board can be increased without altering the logic of the game as long as the length and width of the board are equal.

At the end, the winner or a tie is announced.
